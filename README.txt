-Betfred Code Test-

With luck, this project should compile and run - if not, ensure you have .NetCore 3.1 installed and throw me an email(lucas.courtney@betfred.com) if it's still not running.


These tests are to see how you program and problem solve, if you need to use online resources for help that's fine (we all do it), I would encourage you not to just copy and paste though
as nobody learns anything that way and what you find isn't always the best answer.

Within the 'Tests' folder you'll see 4 sub folders each with a .cs class in it, do all your logic in there in the methods defined (feel free to add further methods if you need to.)

I've included a rudementary example (ExampleTest.cs) with some basic concepts in it. It's by no means perfect but it should give you an idea of how the db access is configured.

A few basic rules:

1) Don't remove any of the logging that is in already (it's there just to make it easier for me to track your results)
2) When logging results, please use ConsoleLog.LogResult - it just shows up green with spacing so, again, I can see the results a little clearer.
3) Don't be afraid to add new packages if you think it's necessary - although I'll likely ask about your choice if you do and why you think it's a best fit.
4) Try to be as efficient as possible, day to day we can deal with relatively high volumes of data so performance is key.
5) Do your logic inside the methods defined for each case
6) Don't stress yourself out with it, if you get in a jam don't panic and do what you're able.
